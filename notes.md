Coming Soon Gem

1.	Plan your gem, imagine your interface
2.	Start with the project structure - google:
how to build a gem
make a gem using bundler (e.g bundle gem daily_deal); - watch the video
how to build a cli gem
3.	Start with the entry point - the file run => bin/coming-soon
													#!/usr/bin/env ruby
													require ‘bundler/setup’
													require ‘coming_soon’
													ComingSoon::CLI.new.call   
						the environment file => lib/coming_soon.rb
													require_relative ‘./coming_soon /version’
													require_relative ‘./coming_soon /movies’
													require_relative ‘./coming_soon /cli’
4.	Force that to build the CLI interface => lib/coming_soon /cli.rb => ComingSoon::CLI
5.	Stub out the interface def call
							   list_movies => scrape data
							    menu       => display menu of movies
							    goodbye  => say goodbye
							end
6.	Start making things real => ComingSoon::Movies
7.	Discover objects
8.	Program
